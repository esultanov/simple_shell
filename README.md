## Tasks

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
- Handle command lines with arguments
- Handle the PATH
- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
- Usage: exit
- Handle arguments for the built-in exit
- Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell
- Handle Ctrl+C: your shell should not quit when the user inputs ^C
- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
- Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
- Implement the builtin command cd:
- Changes the current directory of the process.
- Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
- If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
- You have to handle the command cd -
- You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
- Handle the commands separator ;
- Handle the && and || shell logical operators
- Implement the alias builtin command
```Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias, replaces its value with value```
